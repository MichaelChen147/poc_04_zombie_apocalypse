# Zombie Apocalypse
##Breadth Depth Search Simulation

This was my Zombie Apocalypse submission for Coursera's Principles of Computing course. Currently, this code is intended for use with their [Codeskulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/) Python interpreter, and you can tinker with my version [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user41_bR8hsxFWu0_14.py). I may try to convert this project to work with tkinter or JavaScript if I find the time.

## Project Details and Learning Objectives

This project utilizes a 2D grid of cells that are either empty or occupied by an obstacle, human, or zombie. The project's focus was to create a distance field via breadth first search. This distance field is used in the logic for the humans to run away and for the zombies to stalk their prey.
